## Devlog

All of the essential gameobjects used were the same as the breakdown. A player, gamecontroller, UI text, the coin prefab, and a ground object. The player object has the same
components as expected and a member variable for coins collected through an on trigger method. The gamecontroller dictates coin spawning as in the breakdown with all of the
written methods for the script in the final product. Where this differs is the text script ended up in the game controller script. The background/ground only ended up needing
the box collider.
